		<!--Recipe step one-->
		<div class = "col-md-12 headerFooter"></div>
		<div class = "container">
			<!--Content header buffer div-->
			<div class = "thumbnail outerBorder">
				<div class = "thumbnail borderProperties">

							<p></p>
							<p>Step one.</p>
							<p>Go to turn on the oven, and move the timer instead. You'll be confused as to why the oven doesn't turn on for a moment, and then you'll realise that it's because you turned the wrong knob. Idiot. Fiddle with the timer for a few minutes and try to figure out how to turn it off so it doesn't make that annoying ticking noise or DING! at a random moment so you almost poop your pants. Off yet? Not quite, but that's close enough. If your oven doesn't have a timer, pretend to do this step. People might look at you funny, but that's okay.</p>

							<p></p>
							<p>Step two.</p>
							<p>Start cutting potatoes. Everyone tells you to cut them to the same size, but you know from experience that having incredibly uneven chunks of potato is the best way to go. Who doesn't love biting into a really soft potato and then into a hard one? It's great to keep your dinner guests, guessing. While you're at it, put the potatoes in a big dish which will also house your chicken. Might as well season these beauties. The more salt the better.</p>

						<div class = "col-md-6 recipeDiv">
							
							<p></p>
							<p>Step Three.</p>
							<p>Place the chicken into the dish with the potatoes, pour some oil over it all and pop it in the oven. If your chicken is pre-stuffed and pre-bagged, dont bother making sure the bag is the right way up. It's a better experience for everyone to trap that steam inside so that at some point the bag will explode while cooking, or better, will explode in your face when you take it out the oven. Take a break for now. You deserve it. Dont bother checking on your food. It's perfect. It's beautiful. There's nothing more you need to do.</p>

							<p></p>
							<p>Step five.</p>
							<p>Remove the chicken and potatoes from the oven, and move into seperate bowls. Don't cut the chicken to see if it's cooked. Try to keep it's soul inside for as long as possible by letting it rest for 10 minutes before carving. We all know fresh soul is best. Now that the potatoes are in a different dish, put them back in the oven. Dont notice the fact that the oven isn't very hot. Surely your chicken and potatoes cooked.</p>
